    "about": "Newberry Plaza is a 553-foot (169 m) skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois. It was completed in 1974 and has 53 floors. Gordon and Levin designed the building, which is the 56th tallest in Chicago. When it was completed it was the sixth-tallest all-residential skyscraper in the world. The top 13 floors are slightly wider than the rest of the building, and it is also the first highrise in the city to have townhomes built on top of the building's pedestal.",
