    "about": "Shimer College is a very small, private, undergraduate liberal arts college in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Founded in 1853 as the Mt. Carroll Seminary in the frontier town of Mt. Carroll, Illinois, by Frances Wood Shimer, it was a women's school for most of its early years. It joined with the University of Chicago (U. of C. ) in 1896, and became one of the first junior colleges in the country in 1907. It became a co-educational four-year college in 1950, took the name Shimer College, and adopted the Hutchins Plan of Great Books and Socratic seminars then in practice at the U. of C. The U. of C. relationship ended in 1958. Shimer enjoyed national recognition and strong growth in the 1960s but was forced by financial problems to abandon its campus in 1979. The college moved to a makeshift campus in the Chicago suburb of Waukegan where it remained until 2006, when it moved to the main campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in the Douglas community area of Chicago. Classes are exclusively small seminars in which students discuss original source material in lieu of textbooks. The curriculum, a sequence of courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and integrated studies makes up two thirds of the course work required for a degree. Shimer has offered a study abroad program in Oxford, England, since 1963 and a Weekend Program for working adults since 1981. Applicants are evaluated on their academic potential, primarily based on an essay, and no minimum grades or test scores are required. An Early Entrant program, in place since 1950, allows students who have not yet completed high school to matriculate. It has the highest rates of doctoral productivity of any liberal arts college in the country. Fifty percent of students go on to graduate study; twenty percent complete doctoral degrees. Shimer resides on the IIT main campus, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Shimer practices democratic self-governance to an extent that it states "is rare among institutions of higher education". Since 1977, the college has been governed internally by faculty, staff, and students working through a structure of committees and an egalitarian deliberative body called the Assembly. Shimer enrolled 100 students in 2009. Students maintain Shimer College traditions but also participate in the student life of IIT. Notable alumni include poets, authors, political theorists, experimental artists, and computing pioneers.",
