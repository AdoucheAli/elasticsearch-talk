It was the first building to feature pronounced setbacks and towers resulting from the 1923 zoning law. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on May 29, 1998. When the Allerton first opened, it had fourteen floors of small apartment-style rooms for men and six similar floors for women, with a total of 1,000 rooms. The hotel also boasted social events, gold, sports leagues, a library, solarium, and an in-house magazine. An early resident was Louis Skidmore, founder of the architectural firm Skidmore Owings and Merrill. Senator Dick Durbin stayed at the hotel in 1969 when he traveled to Chicago to take the bar exam. In the 1940s and 1950s, the hotel housed a swanky lounge on its upper story, called the \\\"Tip Top Tap. \\\" Although the lounge closed in 1961, the sign proclaiming its existence is still displayed on the Allerton Hotel. By 1963, the room was home to a new restaurant, the Cloud Room, when Don McNeill moved his broadcast of \\\"Don McNeill's Breakfast Club\\\" to the location. While the show was broadcast from the Allerton, McNeill's guests included regular Fran Allison. After the Allerton Hotel was declared a Chicago landmark, it was closed from August 1998 through May 1999 for a $60,000,000 renovation. The restoration work reversed the hotel's trend toward seediness. When the hotel reopened as the Allerton Crowne Plaza Hotel, the twenty-third floor, which had housed the Tip Top Tap and the Cloud Room, opened as the Renaissance Ballroom. At the same time, a lounge opened on the second floor called Taps on Two, and featured one of the Tip Top Tap's signature drinks, a Moscow Mule. In November 2006, the Allerton Hotel was purchased from Crowne Plaza and sold to the Chartres Lodging Group for $70,000,000. It reopened in February 2, 2007 as the independently owned Allerton Hotel; underneath the Chartres Lodging umbrella of hotels.","lastUpdated":"2012-04-18T12:21:07+0000","wikipedia_id":"Allerton Hotel","wikipedia_numeric_id":11221483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allerton_Hotel","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"allerton_hotel","md5id":"83cc2af4a5b9f48da23ef3fdb4d2630c","description":"The Allerton Hotel is a 25-story 360 foot (110 m) hotel skyscraper along the Magnificent Mile in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois.

Designed by architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad, the building was built for the On Leong Merchants Association and opened in 1928. The Association used it as an immigrant assistance center, and the building was informally referred to as Chinatown's \"city hall. \" In 1988, the FBI and Chicago Police raided the building as part of a racketeering investigation. The US federal government seized the building that same year. The building was purchased by the Chinese Christian Union Church (CCUC) for $1.4 million and renamed the Pui Tak Center in 1993. That same year, the On Leong Merchants Association Building was designated a Chicago landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. The CCUC spent $1 million raised from community donations to renovate and update the building's neglected interior. The newly-named Pai Tak Center now hosts various religious, community and educational programs, such as English-as-a-Second-Language courses (ESL). In 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 grant from the Partners in Preservation, a program sponsored by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In preparation for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed an evaluation of the building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its terra cotta portions.

It is currently located in Lincoln Park in a building at the corner of Clark Street and North Avenue in the Old Town Triangle neighborhood of Lincoln Park in Chicago. It was renamed the Chicago History Museum in September, 2006 by then director Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch, who presumed that Chicagoans were too stupid to understand the original name. He dumbed-down many of the exhibits as well. Much of the early collection amassed by the museum was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, but like the city, the museum rose from the ashes. Among its many documents which were lost in the fire was the original Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham Lincoln. After the fire, the Society began collecting new materials, which were stored in the Scammon Building until it, and their collection, were again destroyed by fire in 1874. The Chicago Historical Society built a fireproof building on the site of its pre-1871 building. The replacement building opened in 1896 and, after housing the collection for thirty-six years, was used for many purposes and often remained vacant until being transformed into a nightclub in 1985. This impressively massive Romanesque building is currently the home of the Excalibur nightclub. In 1920, the Society purchased the large collection of Charles F. Gunther with the intention of changing its focus from a research institution to a more public museum. The current home of the Museum was constructed in 1932, by the WPA, to facilitate that aim. The original Federalist structure has been added on to twice, however both additions have been on the western side and the old facade remains on the park side. In addition to the exhibits, the museum continues to house a research library which is open to the public.","lastUpdated":"2012-04-20T13:21:22+0000","wikipedia_id":"Chicago History Museum","wikipedia_numeric_id":8632525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_History_Museum","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"chicago_history_museum","md5id":"3ccd43e63d8a074d12df6d487a05900d","description":"Chicago History Museum (formerly known as the Chicago Historical Society) was founded in 1856 to study and interpret Chicago's history.

Located on the south bank of the Chicago River, the park is divided into three sections by a Santa Fe rail track and 18th Street. Currently, only development in the area south of 18th Street has been completed. It was designed by Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group and features a pagoda-style pavilion, bamboo gardens and a playground. The park is named in honor of prominent Chinatown businessman and civic leader Ping Tom; a bronze bust of Tom is installed near the park's pavilion. In 1962, the construction preparations for the Dan Ryan Expressway demolished the only two parks in the Chinatown area. Sun Yat-sen Playlot Park, a small, 1/3 acre park, was created in the mid-1970s, however, the community wanted a larger open park space. A private real estate firm formed by Ping Tom, then purchased a former 32-acre (13 ha) rail yard in 1989. After construction of Chinatown Square began on this property, the CPD purchased approximately 6 unused acres along the Chicago River in 1991, along with an additional 6 acres (24,000 m) that extended along the river, north of 18th Street. The southern-half of the area then underwent significant development, as the retaining wall along the river was repaired and an at-grade rail crossing was installed at the park's western boundary. Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5 million. The park was officially opened on October 2, 1999. In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired five additional acres immediately east of the park's undeveloped northern half. The CPD has been planning a second development-stage of the park's nearly 11 undeveloped acres north of 18th Street. The plan calls for the development of the area's shoreline and access points, as well as the construction of a cultural arts and recreational facility and a boathouse. The project is estimated to cost $38 million. In September 2009, a $10 million budget was approved to start development on the 6-acre (24,000 m) area along the Chicago River.","lastUpdated":"2012-02-12T06:12:12+0000","wikipedia_id":"Ping Tom Memorial Park","wikipedia_numeric_id":10904376,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_Tom_Memorial_Park","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"ping_tom_memorial_park","md5id":"7d00cf0b3a4a499684f610dbf5f7c4ba","description":"Ping Tom Memorial Park is a 17.24-acre (6.98 ha) public urban park in Chicago's Chinatown owned and operated by the Chicago Park District (CPD).

Designed by Frederick and Edward Baumann it was built between 1873&ndash;1874 in the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on January 14, 1997. When completed, Washington Block was one of the tallest buildings in the city of Chicago and is described as a rare example of the \"isolated pier foundation\" (see below) which contributed to the foundation of knowledge that has made Chicago the birthplace of the skyscraper. The building has limestone facades and originally included an exterior staircase that led to a second-floor corner entrance. The lobby has a curving hardwood staircase. Today the first floor is occupied by a 7-Eleven. The building, which is located at the corner of North Wells Street and West Washington Street is five storeys tall. The building was originally intended to host upscale offices for companies wanting to be close to the nearby then-blossoming LaSalle Street financial district. However, when the Chicago 'L' was built next to the building, the upscale commercial customer found the building undesirable. During the mid 1900s, the owner hammered off ground-level architectural details in order to modernize the storefronts. 21st century owners have recast some of the details during a restoration. The isolated pier technique uses several separate foundations, one at each of the load-bearing points underground. Thus, instead of using a single foundation that would crack as the building shifted on sandy soil, a building may be built on a much longer-lasting and sturdier foundation. The Washington Block's foundation enabled it to be built on soft, compressible soil, instead of the solid bedrock formerly seen as a requirement. This ability allowed skyscrapers to be built in places like Chicago, and many of them were.","lastUpdated":"2012-07-23T01:46:33+0000","wikipedia_id":"Washington Block","wikipedia_numeric_id":18670278,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Block","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"washington_block","md5id":"20d534f31945562c6ab2771789a760d8","description":"Washington Block is a Chicago Landmark building located in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States.

The Old Town Triangle Historic District is bounded on its northwest side by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way,[3 3] its northeast side by Lincoln Avenue and Wells Street, and on its south side by North Avenue.[4 4] This historic district sits within the Old Town Triangle Association (OTTA), a Lincoln Park neighborhood bounded by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way, Clark Street and North Avenue. It sits inside the community area of Lincoln Park and is part of Chicago's 43rd ward. Old Town north of North Avenue is in Lincoln Park, and south of North Avenue is part of the Near North Side. It is now an affluent gentrified neighborhood. Old Town is today considered an affluent and historic neighborhood, home to many of Chicago's older, Victorian-era buildings. In the 1950s,the majority of this area was an enclave to the first Puerto Ricans to emigrate to Chicago. They referred to this area as part of \"La Clark\" until commercialization decorated late 1960s shop signs with the name of Old Town. The neighborhood is home to St. Michael's Church, originally a Bavarian-built church, and one of 7 to survive the path of the Great Chicago Fire. St. Michael's, Holy Name Cathedral, Immaculate Conception and St. Joseph's catered also to Latinos with Spanish speaking masses. The neighborhood is also home to the famed The Second City improvisational comedy troupe. Many of the streets and alleys, particularly in the Old Town Triangle section, predate the Great Chicago Fire and do not all adhere to a typical Chicago grid pattern. In 1927, sculptors Sol Kogen and Edgar Miller purchased and subsequently rehabilited a house on Burton Place, near Wells Street, into the Carl Street Studios. Through the 1930s, an art colony emerged in the neighborhood as artists moved from the Towertown neighborhood near Washington Square Park. Old Town was also home to many gays &amp; lesbians from the 1950s through the 1980s. There were numerous gay bars lining Wells Street (all of them closed now). This was the first \"gay ghetto\" in Chicago, predating the current Lake View neighborhood (which is the current epicenter of gay life). As the area gentrified, the gays moved further north to Lincoln Park and then Lake View neighborhoods. Old Town has one Brown-Purple Line 'L' station at 1536-40 North Sedgwick Avenue. It is one of the oldest standing stations on the 'L'.","lastUpdated":"2013-01-11T09:49:53+0000","wikipedia_id":"Old Town, Chicago","wikipedia_numeric_id":3415657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town,_Chicago","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"old_town_chicago","md5id":"d2bda40d6e08a955286fbb633d532534","description":"Old Town is a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois, bounded by the Ogden Ave. right-of-way on the northwest, Larrabee Street on the west, Clybourn Avenue on the southwest and Division Street on the south and Clark Street on the east and northeast.

In 1950, the Mission began production of \"Unshackled,\" a radio dramatic series showcasing conversions to Christianity. The show, recorded live at PGM, remains in production today and is translated into seven languages for international distribution. PGM's original location was at 386 S. Clark Street. In 1880, the mission moved to 67 E. Van Buren Street, in a location formerly known as the \"Pacific Beer Garden. \" The current name, \"Pacific Garden Mission,\" was adopted at that time - it was suggested by evangelist D.L. Moody that the name of the former occupant be kept but with the word \"Beer\" dropped from the name. The Mission moved to 646 S. State Street, in 1923, following a shift in the location of Chicago's Skid Row, just south of The Loop. At that time, the area known for its hobo jungles and flophouses. During the past few years the PGM was pressured by the city of Chicago to move from its current location, due to ongoing gentrification in the neighborhood. Then, Jones College Prep, a public high school located at 606 S. State Street, wanted to expand its facilities. As a result, the Mission negotiated with the city in December 2004 to move to a new location at 14th Place and Canal Street, about one mile southwest of its present location. PGM's current structure will be demolished to make way for the Jones College Prep. Groundbreaking for the new facility took place on November 16, 2005, at 1458 S. Canal Street.

Founded in 1853 as the Mt. Carroll Seminary in the frontier town of Mt. Carroll, Illinois, by Frances Wood Shimer, it was a women's school for most of its early years. It joined with the University of Chicago (U. of C. ) in 1896, and became one of the first junior colleges in the country in 1907. It became a co-educational four-year college in 1950, took the name Shimer College, and adopted the Hutchins Plan of Great Books and Socratic seminars then in practice at the U. of C. The U. of C. relationship ended in 1958. Shimer enjoyed national recognition and strong growth in the 1960s but was forced by financial problems to abandon its campus in 1979. The college moved to a makeshift campus in the Chicago suburb of Waukegan where it remained until 2006, when it moved to the main campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in the Douglas community area of Chicago. Classes are exclusively small seminars in which students discuss original source material in lieu of textbooks. The curriculum, a sequence of courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and integrated studies makes up two thirds of the course work required for a degree. Shimer has offered a study abroad program in Oxford, England, since 1963 and a Weekend Program for working adults since 1981. Applicants are evaluated on their academic potential, primarily based on an essay, and no minimum grades or test scores are required. An Early Entrant program, in place since 1950, allows students who have not yet completed high school to matriculate. It has the highest rates of doctoral productivity of any liberal arts college in the country. Fifty percent of students go on to graduate study; twenty percent complete doctoral degrees. Shimer resides on the IIT main campus, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Shimer practices democratic self-governance to an extent that it states \"is rare among institutions of higher education\". Since 1977, the college has been governed internally by faculty, staff, and students working through a structure of committees and an egalitarian deliberative body called the Assembly. Shimer enrolled 100 students in 2009. Students maintain Shimer College traditions but also participate in the student life of IIT. Notable alumni include poets, authors, political theorists, experimental artists, and computing pioneers.","lastUpdated":"2012-02-24T10:38:34+0000","wikipedia_id":"Shimer College","wikipedia_numeric_id":27255579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimer_College","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"shimer_college","md5id":"81483d99209cd5d442d6a1d7f6ddc1a9","description":"Shimer College is a very small, private, undergraduate liberal arts college in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States.

{"geo_geometry_type":"Point","keywords":["former","buildings","structures","chicago,illinois","skyscrapers","office"],"external_links":["http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m/02n_lc"],"about":"The Home Insurance Building was built in 1885 in Chicago, Illinois, USA and destroyed in 1931 to make way for the Field Building. It was the first building to use structural steel in its frame, but the majority of its structure was composed of cast and wrought iron. It is generally noted as the first tall building to be supported, both inside and outside, by a fireproof metal frame. Although, the Ditherington Flax Mill was built as a fireproof metal framed building earlier, it was only five stories tall. Due to the Chicago building's unique architecture and unique weight bearing frame, it is considered to be the first skyscraper in the world. It had 10 stories and rose to a height of 138 feet (42 m). In 1890, two additional floors were built on top of the original 10-story building. A forensic analysis done during its demolition purported to show that the building was the first to carry both floors and external walls entirely on its metal frame, but details and later scholarship have arguably disproved this, and it has been asserted that the structure must have relied upon both metal and masonry elements to support its weight, and to hold it up against wind. Although the Home Insurance Building made full use of steel framing technology, in this theory it was not a pure steel-framed structure since it rested partly on granite piers at the base and on a rear brick wall. The architect was William Le Baron Jenney, an engineer. In fact, the building weighed only one-third as much as a stone building would have; city officials were so concerned that they halted construction while they investigated its safety. The Home Insurance Building is an example of the Chicago School in architecture. The building led to the future in the skyscrapers. \u201A\u00C4\u00FAIn 1888, a Minneapolis architect named Leroy S. Buffington was granted a patent on the idea of building skeletal-frame tall buildings. He even proposed the construction of a 28-story \"stratosphere-scraper\"--a notion mocked by the architectural press of the time as impractical and ludicrous. Nevertheless, Buffington brought the potential of the iron skeletal frame to the attention of the national architectural and building communities. Architects and engineers began using the idea, which in primitive form had been around for decades. \u201A\u00C4\u00F9 The Bank of America Building (former Field Building and then Lasalle Bank Building), where the Home Insurance Building once stood, contains a plaque in the lobby that reads: This section of the Field Building is erected on the site of the Home Insurance Building which structure, designed and built in eighteen hundred and eighty four by the late William Le Baron Jenney, was the first high building to utilize as the basic principle of its design the method known as skeleton construction and, being a primal influence in the acceptance of this principle was the true father of the skyscraper, 1932","lastUpdated":"2012-07-06T01:01:59+0000","wikipedia_id":"Home Insurance Building","wikipedia_numeric_id":8727539,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Insurance_Building","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"home_insurance_building","md5id":"e5279eed17a4f88a85956c6127627a25","description":"The Home Insurance Building was built in 1884 in Chicago, Illinois, USA and destroyed in 1931 to make way for the Field Building.

It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 12, 1974. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973 Wealthy German immigrants, including Wacker, Leight, Gaetner, Deever, and Schlosser, constructed luxurious mansions east of Clark Street in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Francis Dewes, a Chicago brewer and millionaire, built the most elaborate home in the Lincoln Park still standing - Dewes Mansion at 503 West Wrightwood Avenue. Architects Adolph Cudell and Arthur Hercz designed the Dewes mansion, and it was completed in 1896. Hercz was originally from Hungary, and Cudell was no stranger to building grand residences for Chicago's wealthy elite. In 1879 Cudell also designed the Rush Street mansion of prominent businessman Cyrus Hall McCormick. The Dewes mansion was built for Francis J. Dewes, a brewer. Dewes was born in Prusia in 1845, the son of a brewer and member of the German parliament. In 1868 Francis Dewes emigrated to Chicago and found employment as a bookkeeper for established brewing companies such as Rehm and Bartholomae and the Busch and Brand Brewing Company. He rose through the ranks, and in 1882 he founded his own successful brewing firm. His mansion was built to reflect his own Prussian background and European tastes. Taken as a whole, the building is an unusual example of a German inspired style, influenced by the neo-Baroque architecture of Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the end of the nineteenth century. The exterior of this lavish gray-stone is decorated with carved stonework and ornamental cornices and lintels. The entrance to the mansion is flanked by caryatids, tall female figures acting as columns, supporting a balcony over the doorway. The house is now used for wedding receptions, parties, and other private events.","lastUpdated":"2012-12-03T05:15:39+0000","wikipedia_id":"Francis J.

The street has a rich history from its origins as a major trail for horseback riders and carriages. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-block section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic Prairie Avenue District, which was declared a Chicago Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places. Several of Chicago's most important historical figures have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the political history, the architecture, the culture, the economy, as well as the law and government of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the demographics of Chicago. The importance of the street has declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of an historic district. Preservation battles regarding various properties on the street have been notable with one having been chronicled on the front page of The New York Times. As of 2009, the street is being redeveloped to host valuable and important condominiums. Recently, developments have extended the street north to accommodate new high-rise condominiums, such as One Museum Park, along Roosevelt Road (12th Street).

Meigs Field Airport, was a single strip airport that operated from December 1948 until March 2003. It was built on Northerly Island, the man-made peninsula that was also the site of the 1933\u201A\u00C4\u00EC1934 Century of Progress in Chicago. The airport opened on December 10, 1948, and became the country's busiest single-strip airport by 1955. The latest air traffic tower was built in 1952 and the terminal was dedicated in 1961. The airfield was named for Merrill C. Meigs, publisher of the Chicago Herald and Examiner and an aviation booster. Northerly Island, owned by the Chicago Park District, is the only lakefront structure to be built based on Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The island was to be populated by trees and grass for the public enjoyment by all. However, drafted less than six years after the Wright brothers' historic flight, the 1909 plan did not envision any airports for Chicago. The airport was a familiar sight on the downtown lakefront. It was also well-known as the default takeoff field in many early versions of the popular Microsoft Flight Simulator software program. It is an airport that is featured in Microsoft's Midtown Madness computer game (1999) and Reflections' Driver 2 video game, which are based in Chicago. The airport area is also the central location of the short documentary film Powers of Ten by Charles and Ray Eames. The Main Terminal Building was operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and contained waiting areas as well as office and counter space. The runway at Meigs Field was nearly 3,900 feet (1,200 m) long and 150 feet (46 m) wide. In addition, there were four public helicopter pads at the south end of the runway, near McCormick Place. The north end of the runway was near the Adler Planetarium.","lastUpdated":"2012-06-09T05:57:44+0000","wikipedia_id":"Meigs Field","wikipedia_numeric_id":265573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meigs_Field","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"meigs_field","md5id":"216e6f019fb5d76a8400402cf36f550a","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"Merrill C.

Designed by Claes Oldenburg, it takes the shape of a baseball bat standing on its knob. It consists of gray-painted Corten steel arranged into an open latticework structure. Batcolumn stands outside the Harold Washington Social Security Administration Building at 600 West Madison Street near downtown Chicago. The United States General Services Administration commissioned the sculpture, which was dedicated in 1977. Oldenburg originally designed the sculpture to be painted red, but he abandoned that idea to distinguish it from Chicago's Flamingo sculpture by Alexander Calder. Oldenburg instead had Batcolumn painted gray, which he also hoped would make the sculpture easier to see against the sky. A plaque on the sculpture reads, \"Oldenburg selected the baseball bat as an emblem of Chicago's ambition and vigor. The sculpture's verticality echoes the city's dramatic skyline, while its form and scale cleverly allude to more traditional civic monuments, such as obelisks and memorial columns. \" The sculpture has been a source of controversy. On the day of its dedication, a number of people came to protest, holding signs saying \"Tear it down\" and \"Expensive joke\". However, Batcolumn has also had its defenders. A 2005 Chicago Tribune article named it one of the newspaper's favorite Chicago sculptures (along with Standing Lincoln and the lions outside the Art Institute of Chicago Building).","lastUpdated":"2012-10-14T22:08:52+0000","wikipedia_id":"Batcolumn","wikipedia_numeric_id":26436687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcolumn","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"batcolumn","md5id":"84853ae5422a7f913a7c1f7d305585e2","description":"Batcolumn (or Bat Column) is a Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSmid outdoor sculpture in Chicago.

The arena replaced Dexter Park, a horse-racing track that had stood on the site for over 50 years prior to its destruction by fire in May 1934. The completion of the Amphitheater ushered in an era where Chicago reigned as a convention capital. In an era before air conditioning and space for the press and broadcast media were commonplace, the International Amphitheater was among the first arenas to be equipped with these innovations. The arena, which seated 9,000, was the first home of the Chicago Packers of the NBA during 1961-62, before changing their name to the Chicago Zephyrs and moving to the Chicago Coliseum for their second season. It was also the home of the Chicago Bulls during their inaugural season of 1966-67; they also played only one game in the Chicago Coliseum, a playoff game in their first season, as no other arena was available for a game versus the St. Louis Hawks. Afterwards, the Bulls then moved permanently to Chicago Stadium, not the Coliseum. The Amphitheatre was also the primary home of the Chicago Cougars of the WHA from 1972-1975.

It is bronze work of art created between 1907-1913. The fountain depicts five women arranged so that the water flows through them in the same way water passes through the Great Lakes. Note that the Great Lakes waterflow starts in Lake Superior at 600 feet (180 m) above sea level and continues eastward through each lake until it reaches Lake Ontario and then passes into the St. Lawrence River. The Fountain is one of Taft's best known works. The fountain was originally installed facing south where it remained until 1963 when it was moved next to the Morton Wing addition facing west where it sits today. In its original location it was visible from the Jackson and Michigan Avenue intersection once known as \"route center\" to the south. The fountain was commissioned by the Benjamin Ferguson fund and one surface references the title B. F. Ferguson Fountain of the Great Lakes. There is a relief sculpture of Benjamin Ferguson on the rear panel that has been hidden from view since the fountain was moved. As the first commission from the Ferguson Fund, it experienced various funding delays. Additionally, the legal environment for land use in Grant Park was in flux at the time the commission was made, which caused delays in location selection. Once erected, the fountain received largely positive reviews, but a few critics questioned symbolism of the sculpture. Others were caught up in sociopolitical subtexts of the day, with regard to obscenity laws as it related to public art and this semi-nude work.","lastUpdated":"2012-12-03T15:19:46+0000","wikipedia_id":"Fountain of the Great Lakes","wikipedia_numeric_id":11721566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_the_Great_Lakes","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"fountain_of_the_great_lakes","md5id":"ddf3e566975589e6c2b71894e2f9c031","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"Fountain of the Great Lakes or Spirit of the Great Lakes Fountain is an allegorical sculpture by Lorado Taft in the Art Institute of Chicago South Stanley McCormick Memorial Court south of the Art Institute of Chicago Building in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States.

It was the first building to feature pronounced setbacks and towers resulting from the 1923 zoning law. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on May 29, 1998. When the Allerton first opened, it had fourteen floors of small apartment-style rooms for men and six similar floors for women, with a total of 1,000 rooms. The hotel also boasted social events, gold, sports leagues, a library, solarium, and an in-house magazine. An early resident was Louis Skidmore, founder of the architectural firm Skidmore Owings and Merrill. Senator Dick Durbin stayed at the hotel in 1969 when he traveled to Chicago to take the bar exam. In the 1940s and 1950s, the hotel housed a swanky lounge on its upper story, called the \\\"Tip Top Tap. \\\" Although the lounge closed in 1961, the sign proclaiming its existence is still displayed on the Allerton Hotel. By 1963, the room was home to a new restaurant, the Cloud Room, when Don McNeill moved his broadcast of \\\"Don McNeill's Breakfast Club\\\" to the location. While the show was broadcast from the Allerton, McNeill's guests included regular Fran Allison. After the Allerton Hotel was declared a Chicago landmark, it was closed from August 1998 through May 1999 for a $60,000,000 renovation. The restoration work reversed the hotel's trend toward seediness. When the hotel reopened as the Allerton Crowne Plaza Hotel, the twenty-third floor, which had housed the Tip Top Tap and the Cloud Room, opened as the Renaissance Ballroom. At the same time, a lounge opened on the second floor called Taps on Two, and featured one of the Tip Top Tap's signature drinks, a Moscow Mule. In November 2006, the Allerton Hotel was purchased from Crowne Plaza and sold to the Chartres Lodging Group for $70,000,000. It reopened in February 2, 2007 as the independently owned Allerton Hotel; underneath the Chartres Lodging umbrella of hotels.","lastUpdated":"2012-02-17T05:38:28+0000","wikipedia_id":"Allerton Hotel","wikipedia_numeric_id":11221483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allerton_Hotel","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"allerton_hotel","md5id":"83cc2af4a5b9f48da23ef3fdb4d2630c","description":"The Allerton Hotel is a 25-story 360 foot (110 m) hotel skyscraper along the Magnificent Mile in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois.

Designed by architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad, the building was built for the On Leong Merchants Association and opened in 1928. The Association used it as an immigrant assistance center, and the building was informally referred to as Chinatown's \"city hall. \" In 1988, the FBI and Chicago Police raided the building as part of a racketeering investigation. The US federal government seized the building that same year. The building was purchased by the Chinese Christian Union Church (CCUC) for $1.4 million and renamed the Pui Tak Center in 1993. That same year, the On Leong Merchants Association Building was designated a Chicago landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. The CCUC spent $1 million raised from community donations to renovate and update the building's neglected interior. The newly-named Pai Tak Center now hosts various religious, community and educational programs, such as English-as-a-Second-Language courses (ESL). In 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 grant from the Partners in Preservation, a program sponsored by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In preparation for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed an evaluation of the building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its terra cotta portions.

It is currently located in Lincoln Park in a building at the corner of Clark Street and North Avenue in the Old Town Triangle neighborhood of Lincoln Park in Chicago. It was renamed the Chicago History Museum in September, 2006 by then director Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch, who presumed that Chicagoans were too stupid to understand the original name. He dumbed-down many of the exhibits as well. Much of the early collection amassed by the museum was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, but like the city, the museum rose from the ashes. Among its many documents which were lost in the fire was the original Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham Lincoln. After the fire, the Society began collecting new materials, which were stored in the Scammon Building until it, and their collection, were again destroyed by fire in 1874. The Chicago Historical Society built a fireproof building on the site of its pre-1871 building. The replacement building opened in 1896 and, after housing the collection for thirty-six years, was used for many purposes and often remained vacant until being transformed into a nightclub in 1985. This impressively massive Romanesque building is currently the home of the Excalibur nightclub. In 1920, the Society purchased the large collection of Charles F. Gunther with the intention of changing its focus from a research institution to a more public museum. The current home of the Museum was constructed in 1932, by the WPA, to facilitate that aim. The original Federalist structure has been added on to twice, however both additions have been on the western side and the old facade remains on the park side. In addition to the exhibits, the museum continues to house a research library which is open to the public.","lastUpdated":"2012-07-11T06:36:08+0000","wikipedia_id":"Chicago History Museum","wikipedia_numeric_id":8632525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_History_Museum","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"chicago_history_museum","md5id":"3ccd43e63d8a074d12df6d487a05900d","description":"Chicago History Museum (formerly known as the Chicago Historical Society) was founded in 1856 to study and interpret Chicago's history.

Located on the south bank of the Chicago River, the park is divided into three sections by a Santa Fe rail track and 18th Street. Currently, only development in the area south of 18th Street has been completed. It was designed by Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group and features a pagoda-style pavilion, bamboo gardens and a playground. The park is named in honor of prominent Chinatown businessman and civic leader Ping Tom; a bronze bust of Tom is installed near the park's pavilion. In 1962, the construction preparations for the Dan Ryan Expressway demolished the only two parks in the Chinatown area. Sun Yat-sen Playlot Park, a small, 1/3 acre park, was created in the mid-1970s, however, the community wanted a larger open park space. A private real estate firm formed by Ping Tom, then purchased a former 32-acre (13 ha) rail yard in 1989. After construction of Chinatown Square began on this property, the CPD purchased approximately 6 unused acres along the Chicago River in 1991, along with an additional 6 acres (24,000 m) that extended along the river, north of 18th Street. The southern-half of the area then underwent significant development, as the retaining wall along the river was repaired and an at-grade rail crossing was installed at the park's western boundary. Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5 million. The park was officially opened on October 2, 1999. In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired five additional acres immediately east of the park's undeveloped northern half. The CPD has been planning a second development-stage of the park's nearly 11 undeveloped acres north of 18th Street. The plan calls for the development of the area's shoreline and access points, as well as the construction of a cultural arts and recreational facility and a boathouse. The project is estimated to cost $38 million. In September 2009, a $10 million budget was approved to start development on the 6-acre (24,000 m) area along the Chicago River.","lastUpdated":"2012-03-24T04:30:14+0000","wikipedia_id":"Ping Tom Memorial Park","wikipedia_numeric_id":10904376,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_Tom_Memorial_Park","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"ping_tom_memorial_park","md5id":"7d00cf0b3a4a499684f610dbf5f7c4ba","description":"Ping Tom Memorial Park is a 17.24-acre (6.98 ha) public urban park in Chicago's Chinatown owned and operated by the Chicago Park District (CPD).

Designed by Frederick and Edward Baumann it was built between 1873&ndash;1874 in the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on January 14, 1997. When completed, Washington Block was one of the tallest buildings in the city of Chicago and is described as a rare example of the \"isolated pier foundation\" (see below) which contributed to the foundation of knowledge that has made Chicago the birthplace of the skyscraper. The building has limestone facades and originally included an exterior staircase that led to a second-floor corner entrance. The lobby has a curving hardwood staircase. Today the first floor is occupied by a 7-Eleven. The building, which is located at the corner of North Wells Street and West Washington Street is five storeys tall. The building was originally intended to host upscale offices for companies wanting to be close to the nearby then-blossoming LaSalle Street financial district. However, when the Chicago 'L' was built next to the building, the upscale commercial customer found the building undesirable. During the mid 1900s, the owner hammered off ground-level architectural details in order to modernize the storefronts. 21st century owners have recast some of the details during a restoration. The isolated pier technique uses several separate foundations, one at each of the load-bearing points underground. Thus, instead of using a single foundation that would crack as the building shifted on sandy soil, a building may be built on a much longer-lasting and sturdier foundation. The Washington Block's foundation enabled it to be built on soft, compressible soil, instead of the solid bedrock formerly seen as a requirement. This ability allowed skyscrapers to be built in places like Chicago, and many of them were.","lastUpdated":"2012-04-04T01:53:02+0000","wikipedia_id":"Washington Block","wikipedia_numeric_id":18670278,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Block","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"washington_block","md5id":"20d534f31945562c6ab2771789a760d8","description":"Washington Block is a Chicago Landmark building located in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States.

Old Town includes the Old Town Triangle Historic District. The Old Town Triangle Historic District is bounded on its northwest side by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way,[3 3] its northeast side by Lincoln Avenue and Wells Street, and on its south side by North Avenue.[4 4] This historic district sits within the Old Town Triangle Association (OTTA), a Lincoln Park neighborhood bounded by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way, Clark Street and North Avenue. It sits inside the community area of Lincoln Park and is part of Chicago's 43rd ward. Old Town north of North Avenue is in Lincoln Park, and south of North Avenue is part of the Near North Side. It is now an affluent gentrified neighborhood. Old Town is today considered an affluent and historic neighborhood, home to many of Chicago's older, Victorian-era buildings. In the 1950s,the majority of this area was an enclave to the first Puerto Ricans to emigrate to Chicago. They referred to this area as part of \"La Clark\" until commercialization decorated late 1960s shop signs with the name of Old Town. The neighborhood is home to St. Michael's Church, originally a Bavarian-built church, and one of 7 to survive the path of the Great Chicago Fire. St. Michael's, Holy Name Cathedral, Immaculate Conception and St. Joseph's catered also to Latinos with Spanish speaking masses. The neighborhood is also home to the famed The Second City improvisational comedy troupe. Many of the streets and alleys, particularly in the Old Town Triangle section, predate the Great Chicago Fire and do not all adhere to a typical Chicago grid pattern. In 1927, sculptors Sol Kogen and Edgar Miller purchased and subsequently rehabilited a house on Burton Place, near Wells Street, into the Carl Street Studios. Through the 1930s, an art colony emerged in the neighborhood as artists moved from the Towertown neighborhood near Washington Square Park. Old Town was also home to many gays &amp; lesbians from the 1950s through the 1980s. There were numerous gay bars lining Wells Street (all of them closed now). This was the first \"gay ghetto\" in Chicago, predating the current Lake View neighborhood (which is the current epicenter of gay life). As the area gentrified, the gays moved further north to Lincoln Park and then Lake View neighborhoods. Old Town has one Brown-Purple Line 'L' station at 1536-40 North Sedgwick Avenue. It is one of the oldest standing stations on the 'L'.","lastUpdated":"2012-10-13T10:40:54+0000","wikipedia_id":"Old Town, Chicago","wikipedia_numeric_id":3415657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town,_Chicago","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"old_town_chicago","md5id":"d2bda40d6e08a955286fbb633d532534","description":"Old Town is a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois, bounded by the Ogden Ave. right-of-way on the northwest, Larrabee Street on the west, Clybourn Avenue on the southwest and Division Street on the south and Clark Street on the east and northeast.

According to the PGM website, \"Pacific Garden Mission is the oldest, continuously operating rescue mission in the country. \" Among the converts to Christ from PGM's efforts are the famous evangelists Billy Sunday and Mel Trotter. In 1950, the Mission began production of \"Unshackled,\" a radio dramatic series showcasing conversions to Christianity. The show, recorded live at PGM, remains in production today and is translated into seven languages for international distribution. PGM's original location was at 386 S. Clark Street. In 1880, the mission moved to 67 E. Van Buren Street, in a location formerly known as the \"Pacific Beer Garden. \" The current name, \"Pacific Garden Mission,\" was adopted at that time - it was suggested by evangelist D.L. Moody that the name of the former occupant be kept but with the word \"Beer\" dropped from the name. The Mission moved to 646 S. State Street, in 1923, following a shift in the location of Chicago's Skid Row, just south of The Loop. At that time, the area known for its hobo jungles and flophouses. During the past few years the PGM was pressured by the city of Chicago to move from its current location, due to ongoing gentrification in the neighborhood. Then, Jones College Prep, a public high school located at 606 S. State Street, wanted to expand its facilities. As a result, the Mission negotiated with the city in December 2004 to move to a new location at 14th Place and Canal Street, about one mile southwest of its present location. PGM's current structure will be demolished to make way for the Jones College Prep. Groundbreaking for the new facility took place on November 16, 2005, at 1458 S. Canal Street.

Founded in 1853 as the Mt. Carroll Seminary in the frontier town of Mt. Carroll, Illinois, by Frances Wood Shimer, it was a women's school for most of its early years. It joined with the University of Chicago (U. of C. ) in 1896, and became one of the first junior colleges in the country in 1907. It became a co-educational four-year college in 1950, took the name Shimer College, and adopted the Hutchins Plan of Great Books and Socratic seminars then in practice at the U. of C. The U. of C. relationship ended in 1958. Shimer enjoyed national recognition and strong growth in the 1960s but was forced by financial problems to abandon its campus in 1979. The college moved to a makeshift campus in the Chicago suburb of Waukegan where it remained until 2006, when it moved to the main campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in the Douglas community area of Chicago. Classes are exclusively small seminars in which students discuss original source material in lieu of textbooks. The curriculum, a sequence of courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and integrated studies makes up two thirds of the course work required for a degree. Shimer has offered a study abroad program in Oxford, England, since 1963 and a Weekend Program for working adults since 1981. Applicants are evaluated on their academic potential, primarily based on an essay, and no minimum grades or test scores are required. An Early Entrant program, in place since 1950, allows students who have not yet completed high school to matriculate. It has the highest rates of doctoral productivity of any liberal arts college in the country. Fifty percent of students go on to graduate study; twenty percent complete doctoral degrees. Shimer resides on the IIT main campus, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Shimer practices democratic self-governance to an extent that it states \"is rare among institutions of higher education\". Since 1977, the college has been governed internally by faculty, staff, and students working through a structure of committees and an egalitarian deliberative body called the Assembly. Shimer enrolled 100 students in 2009. Students maintain Shimer College traditions but also participate in the student life of IIT. Notable alumni include poets, authors, political theorists, experimental artists, and computing pioneers.","lastUpdated":"2012-08-16T01:10:53+0000","wikipedia_id":"Shimer College","wikipedia_numeric_id":27255579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimer_College","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"shimer_college","md5id":"81483d99209cd5d442d6a1d7f6ddc1a9","description":"Shimer College is a very small, private, undergraduate liberal arts college in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States.

It was the first building to use structural steel in its frame, but the majority of its structure was composed of cast and wrought iron. It is generally noted as the first tall building to be supported, both inside and outside, by a fireproof metal frame. Although, the Ditherington Flax Mill was built as a fireproof metal framed building earlier, it was only five stories tall. Due to the Chicago building's unique architecture and unique weight bearing frame, it is considered to be the first skyscraper in the world. It had 10 stories and rose to a height of 138 feet (42 m). In 1890, two additional floors were built on top of the original 10-story building. A forensic analysis done during its demolition purported to show that the building was the first to carry both floors and external walls entirely on its metal frame, but details and later scholarship have arguably disproved this, and it has been asserted that the structure must have relied upon both metal and masonry elements to support its weight, and to hold it up against wind. Although the Home Insurance Building made full use of steel framing technology, in this theory it was not a pure steel-framed structure since it rested partly on granite piers at the base and on a rear brick wall. The architect was William Le Baron Jenney, an engineer. In fact, the building weighed only one-third as much as a stone building would have; city officials were so concerned that they halted construction while they investigated its safety. The Home Insurance Building is an example of the Chicago School in architecture. The building led to the future in the skyscrapers. \u00E2\u0080\u009CIn 1888, a Minneapolis architect named Leroy S. Buffington was granted a patent on the idea of building skeletal-frame tall buildings. He even proposed the construction of a 28-story \"stratosphere-scraper\"--a notion mocked by the architectural press of the time as impractical and ludicrous. Nevertheless, Buffington brought the potential of the iron skeletal frame to the attention of the national architectural and building communities. Architects and engineers began using the idea, which in primitive form had been around for decades. \u00E2\u0080\u009D The Bank of America Building (former Field Building and then Lasalle Bank Building), where the Home Insurance Building once stood, contains a plaque in the lobby that reads: This section of the Field Building is erected on the site of the Home Insurance Building which structure, designed and built in eighteen hundred and eighty four by the late William Le Baron Jenney, was the first high building to utilize as the basic principle of its design the method known as skeleton construction and, being a primal influence in the acceptance of this principle was the true father of the skyscraper, 1932","lastUpdated":"2012-07-13T20:17:44+0000","wikipedia_id":"Home Insurance Building","wikipedia_numeric_id":8727539,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Insurance_Building","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"home_insurance_building","md5id":"e5279eed17a4f88a85956c6127627a25","description":"The Home Insurance Building was built in 1884 in Chicago, Illinois, USA and destroyed in 1931 to make way for the Field Building.

Dewes House is a house located at 503 West Wrightwood Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The house was built in 1896 by Adolph Cudell and Arthur Hercz for brewer Francis J. Dewes. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 12, 1974. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973 Wealthy German immigrants, including Wacker, Leight, Gaetner, Deever, and Schlosser, constructed luxurious mansions east of Clark Street in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Francis Dewes, a Chicago brewer and millionaire, built the most elaborate home in the Lincoln Park still standing - Dewes Mansion at 503 West Wrightwood Avenue. Architects Adolph Cudell and Arthur Hercz designed the Dewes mansion, and it was completed in 1896. Hercz was originally from Hungary, and Cudell was no stranger to building grand residences for Chicago's wealthy elite. In 1879 Cudell also designed the Rush Street mansion of prominent businessman Cyrus Hall McCormick. The Dewes mansion was built for Francis J. Dewes, a brewer. Dewes was born in Prusia in 1845, the son of a brewer and member of the German parliament. In 1868 Francis Dewes emigrated to Chicago and found employment as a bookkeeper for established brewing companies such as Rehm and Bartholomae and the Busch and Brand Brewing Company. He rose through the ranks, and in 1882 he founded his own successful brewing firm. His mansion was built to reflect his own Prussian background and European tastes. Taken as a whole, the building is an unusual example of a German inspired style, influenced by the neo-Baroque architecture of Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the end of the nineteenth century. The exterior of this lavish gray-stone is decorated with carved stonework and ornamental cornices and lintels. The entrance to the mansion is flanked by caryatids, tall female figures acting as columns, supporting a balcony over the doorway. The house is now used for wedding receptions, parties, and other private events.","lastUpdated":"2012-12-18T18:08:15+0000","wikipedia_id":"Francis J.

The street has a rich history from its origins as a major trail for horseback riders and carriages. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-block section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic Prairie Avenue District, which was declared a Chicago Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places. Several of Chicago's most important historical figures have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the political history, the architecture, the culture, the economy, as well as the law and government of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the demographics of Chicago. The importance of the street has declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of an historic district. Preservation battles regarding various properties on the street have been notable with one having been chronicled on the front page of The New York Times. As of 2009, the street is being redeveloped to host valuable and important condominiums. Recently, developments have extended the street north to accommodate new high-rise condominiums, such as One Museum Park, along Roosevelt Road (12th Street). The redevelopment has extended the street so that it has prominent buildings bordering Grant Park with Prairie Avenue addresses.","lastUpdated":"2012-12-05T14:26:41+0000","wikipedia_id":"Prairie Avenue","wikipedia_numeric_id":25571074,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_Avenue","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"prairie_avenue","md5id":"accb3688c3022226830895ab523bbf8b","description":"Prairie Avenue is a north\\u2013south thoroughfare on the South Side of Chicago, which historically extended from 16th Street in the Near South Side community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States, to the city's southern limits and beyond.

The airport opened on December 10, 1948, and became the country's busiest single-strip airport by 1955. The latest air traffic tower was built in 1952 and the terminal was dedicated in 1961. The airfield was named for Merrill C. Meigs, publisher of the Chicago Herald and Examiner and an aviation booster. Northerly Island, owned by the Chicago Park District, is the only lakefront structure to be built based on Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The island was to be populated by trees and grass for the public enjoyment by all. However, drafted less than six years after the Wright brothers' historic flight, the 1909 plan did not envision any airports for Chicago. The airport was a familiar sight on the downtown lakefront. It was also well-known as the default takeoff field in many early versions of the popular Microsoft Flight Simulator software program. It is an airport that is featured in Microsoft's Midtown Madness computer game (1999) and Reflections' Driver 2 video game, which are based in Chicago. The airport area is also the central location of the short documentary film Powers of Ten by Charles and Ray Eames. The Main Terminal Building was operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and contained waiting areas as well as office and counter space. The runway at Meigs Field was nearly 3,900 feet (1,200 m) long and 150 feet (46 m) wide. In addition, there were four public helicopter pads at the south end of the runway, near McCormick Place. The north end of the runway was near the Adler Planetarium.","lastUpdated":"2012-04-08T20:01:01+0000","wikipedia_id":"Meigs Field","wikipedia_numeric_id":265573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meigs_Field","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"meigs_field","md5id":"216e6f019fb5d76a8400402cf36f550a","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"Merrill C.

Designed by Claes Oldenburg, it takes the shape of a baseball bat standing on its knob. It consists of gray-painted Corten steel arranged into an open latticework structure. Batcolumn stands outside the Harold Washington Social Security Administration Building at 600 West Madison Street near downtown Chicago. The United States General Services Administration commissioned the sculpture, which was dedicated in 1977. Oldenburg originally designed the sculpture to be painted red, but he abandoned that idea to distinguish it from Chicago's Flamingo sculpture by Alexander Calder. Oldenburg instead had Batcolumn painted gray, which he also hoped would make the sculpture easier to see against the sky. A plaque on the sculpture reads, \"Oldenburg selected the baseball bat as an emblem of Chicago's ambition and vigor. The sculpture's verticality echoes the city's dramatic skyline, while its form and scale cleverly allude to more traditional civic monuments, such as obelisks and memorial columns. \" The sculpture has been a source of controversy. On the day of its dedication, a number of people came to protest, holding signs saying \"Tear it down\" and \"Expensive joke\". However, Batcolumn has also had its defenders. A 2005 Chicago Tribune article named it one of the newspaper's favorite Chicago sculptures (along with Standing Lincoln and the lions outside the Art Institute of Chicago Building).","lastUpdated":"2012-07-22T23:57:40+0000","wikipedia_id":"Batcolumn","wikipedia_numeric_id":26436687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcolumn","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"batcolumn","md5id":"84853ae5422a7f913a7c1f7d305585e2","description":"Batcolumn (or Bat Column) is a Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSmid outdoor sculpture in Chicago.

The arena replaced Dexter Park, a horse-racing track that had stood on the site for over 50 years prior to its destruction by fire in May 1934. The completion of the Amphitheater ushered in an era where Chicago reigned as a convention capital. In an era before air conditioning and space for the press and broadcast media were commonplace, the International Amphitheater was among the first arenas to be equipped with these innovations. The arena, which seated 9,000, was the first home of the Chicago Packers of the NBA during 1961-62, before changing their name to the Chicago Zephyrs and moving to the Chicago Coliseum for their second season. It was also the home of the Chicago Bulls during their inaugural season of 1966-67; they also played only one game in the Chicago Coliseum, a playoff game in their first season, as no other arena was available for a game versus the St. Louis Hawks. Afterwards, the Bulls then moved permanently to Chicago Stadium, not the Coliseum. The Amphitheatre was also the primary home of the Chicago Cougars of the WHA from 1972-1975.

Note that the Great Lakes waterflow starts in Lake Superior at 600 feet (180 m) above sea level and continues eastward through each lake until it reaches Lake Ontario and then passes into the St. Lawrence River. The Fountain is one of Taft's best known works. The fountain was originally installed facing south where it remained until 1963 when it was moved next to the Morton Wing addition facing west where it sits today. In its original location it was visible from the Jackson and Michigan Avenue intersection once known as \"route center\" to the south. The fountain was commissioned by the Benjamin Ferguson fund and one surface references the title B. F. Ferguson Fountain of the Great Lakes. There is a relief sculpture of Benjamin Ferguson on the rear panel that has been hidden from view since the fountain was moved. As the first commission from the Ferguson Fund, it experienced various funding delays. Additionally, the legal environment for land use in Grant Park was in flux at the time the commission was made, which caused delays in location selection. Once erected, the fountain received largely positive reviews, but a few critics questioned symbolism of the sculpture. Others were caught up in sociopolitical subtexts of the day, with regard to obscenity laws as it related to public art and this semi-nude work.","lastUpdated":"2013-01-09T19:39:05+0000","wikipedia_id":"Fountain of the Great Lakes","wikipedia_numeric_id":11721566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_the_Great_Lakes","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"fountain_of_the_great_lakes","md5id":"ddf3e566975589e6c2b71894e2f9c031","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"Fountain of the Great Lakes or Spirit of the Great Lakes Fountain is an allegorical sculpture by Lorado Taft in the Art Institute of Chicago South Stanley McCormick Memorial Court south of the Art Institute of Chicago Building in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States.

It was the first building to feature pronounced setbacks and towers resulting from the 1923 zoning law. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on May 29, 1998. When the Allerton first opened, it had fourteen floors of small apartment-style rooms for men and six similar floors for women, with a total of 1,000 rooms. The hotel also boasted social events, gold, sports leagues, a library, solarium, and an in-house magazine. An early resident was Louis Skidmore, founder of the architectural firm Skidmore Owings and Merrill. Senator Dick Durbin stayed at the hotel in 1969 when he traveled to Chicago to take the bar exam. In the 1940s and 1950s, the hotel housed a swanky lounge on its upper story, called the \\\"Tip Top Tap. \\\" Although the lounge closed in 1961, the sign proclaiming its existence is still displayed on the Allerton Hotel. By 1963, the room was home to a new restaurant, the Cloud Room, when Don McNeill moved his broadcast of \\\"Don McNeill's Breakfast Club\\\" to the location. While the show was broadcast from the Allerton, McNeill's guests included regular Fran Allison. After the Allerton Hotel was declared a Chicago landmark, it was closed from August 1998 through May 1999 for a $60,000,000 renovation. The restoration work reversed the hotel's trend toward seediness. When the hotel reopened as the Allerton Crowne Plaza Hotel, the twenty-third floor, which had housed the Tip Top Tap and the Cloud Room, opened as the Renaissance Ballroom. At the same time, a lounge opened on the second floor called Taps on Two, and featured one of the Tip Top Tap's signature drinks, a Moscow Mule. In November 2006, the Allerton Hotel was purchased from Crowne Plaza and sold to the Chartres Lodging Group for $70,000,000. It reopened in February 2, 2007 as the independently owned Allerton Hotel; underneath the Chartres Lodging umbrella of hotels.","lastUpdated":"2012-10-22T08:01:09+0000","wikipedia_id":"Allerton Hotel","wikipedia_numeric_id":11221483,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allerton_Hotel","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"allerton_hotel","md5id":"83cc2af4a5b9f48da23ef3fdb4d2630c","description":"The Allerton Hotel is a 25-story 360 foot (110 m) hotel skyscraper along the Magnificent Mile in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois.

As a result of consistent victories in the fields of sports and academics, the school is known as the \"School of Champions\". Lane has also produced more Ph.D. holders than any other high school in the country. Since Lane is one of nine selective enrollment schools in Chicago, most students have to commute to Lane. As a result, Lane is a diverse school with many of its students coming from different ethnicities and economic backgrounds which helps enrich the school's student body. To celebrate the school's diversity, Lane hosts dozens of ethnic clubs which help students learn more about other cultures as well as prepare for the International Days festivities. Lane's annual yearbook is called the Arrowhead.","lastUpdated":"2012-03-02T22:18:15+0000","wikipedia_id":"Lane Technical College Prep High School","wikipedia_numeric_id":3616501,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Technical_College_Prep_High_School","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"lane_technical_college_prep_high_school","extended_properties":{"school.campus_size":"0.133536619392"},"md5id":"97e32aa0cd50404d94e3fafd6039e019","description":"Albert G.

Designed by architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad, the building was built for the On Leong Merchants Association and opened in 1928. The Association used it as an immigrant assistance center, and the building was informally referred to as Chinatown's \"city hall. \" In 1988, the FBI and Chicago Police raided the building as part of a racketeering investigation. The US federal government seized the building that same year. The building was purchased by the Chinese Christian Union Church (CCUC) for $1.4 million and renamed the Pui Tak Center in 1993. That same year, the On Leong Merchants Association Building was designated a Chicago landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. The CCUC spent $1 million raised from community donations to renovate and update the building's neglected interior. The newly-named Pai Tak Center now hosts various religious, community and educational programs, such as English-as-a-Second-Language courses (ESL). In 2007, the Pui Tak Center won a $100,000 grant from the Partners in Preservation, a program sponsored by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In preparation for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed an evaluation of the building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its terra cotta portions. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010.

It is currently located in Lincoln Park in a building at the corner of Clark Street and North Avenue in the Old Town Triangle neighborhood of Lincoln Park in Chicago. It was renamed the Chicago History Museum in September, 2006 by then director Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch, who presumed that Chicagoans were too stupid to understand the original name. He dumbed-down many of the exhibits as well. Much of the early collection amassed by the museum was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, but like the city, the museum rose from the ashes. Among its many documents which were lost in the fire was the original Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham Lincoln. After the fire, the Society began collecting new materials, which were stored in the Scammon Building until it, and their collection, were again destroyed by fire in 1874. The Chicago Historical Society built a fireproof building on the site of its pre-1871 building. The replacement building opened in 1896 and, after housing the collection for thirty-six years, was used for many purposes and often remained vacant until being transformed into a nightclub in 1985. This impressively massive Romanesque building is currently the home of the Excalibur nightclub. In 1920, the Society purchased the large collection of Charles F. Gunther with the intention of changing its focus from a research institution to a more public museum. The current home of the Museum was constructed in 1932, by the WPA, to facilitate that aim. The original Federalist structure has been added on to twice, however both additions have been on the western side and the old facade remains on the park side. In addition to the exhibits, the museum continues to house a research library which is open to the public.","lastUpdated":"2012-10-18T12:30:40+0000","wikipedia_id":"Chicago History Museum","wikipedia_numeric_id":8632525,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_History_Museum","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"chicago_history_museum","md5id":"3ccd43e63d8a074d12df6d487a05900d","description":"Chicago History Museum (formerly known as the Chicago Historical Society) was founded in 1856 to study and interpret Chicago's history.

Completed in 1989, the 37-story building reaches a height of 627 feet (191 m). The design, by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, is considered one of the finest reproductions of the Art Deco style and similar to the GE Building in New York City. The tower is further enhanced by the use of limestone piers and recessed tinted glass with granite spandrels. The building takes cues from the nearby landmark Tribune Tower with the use of flying buttresses. A 130-foot (40 m) broadcast tower and spire tops the skyscraper. WMAQ/NBC has STL and satellite facilities on the roof and does not actually transmit from the tower, as those facilities are atop Willis Tower. The building, located in the Cityfront Plaza area, contains 850,000 square feet (79,000 m) of space and three floors of underground parking with 261 spaces. Connected to the main tower is a four-story radio and television broadcasting facility where popular shows such as Jerry Springer and The Steve Wilkos Show were taped.","lastUpdated":"2012-11-09T18:28:50+0000","wikipedia_id":"NBC Tower","wikipedia_numeric_id":9907464,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Tower","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"nbc_tower","md5id":"25f60995ff8457f7526d3623b9117705","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"The NBC Tower is an office tower on the Near north side of Chicago, Illinois, United States.

Located on the south bank of the Chicago River, the park is divided into three sections by a Santa Fe rail track and 18th Street. Currently, only development in the area south of 18th Street has been completed. It was designed by Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group and features a pagoda-style pavilion, bamboo gardens and a playground. The park is named in honor of prominent Chinatown businessman and civic leader Ping Tom; a bronze bust of Tom is installed near the park's pavilion. In 1962, the construction preparations for the Dan Ryan Expressway demolished the only two parks in the Chinatown area. Sun Yat-sen Playlot Park, a small, 1/3 acre park, was created in the mid-1970s, however, the community wanted a larger open park space. A private real estate firm formed by Ping Tom, then purchased a former 32-acre (13 ha) rail yard in 1989. After construction of Chinatown Square began on this property, the CPD purchased approximately 6 unused acres along the Chicago River in 1991, along with an additional 6 acres (24,000 m) that extended along the river, north of 18th Street. The southern-half of the area then underwent significant development, as the retaining wall along the river was repaired and an at-grade rail crossing was installed at the park's western boundary. Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5 million. The park was officially opened on October 2, 1999. In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired five additional acres immediately east of the park's undeveloped northern half. The CPD has been planning a second development-stage of the park's nearly 11 undeveloped acres north of 18th Street. The plan calls for the development of the area's shoreline and access points, as well as the construction of a cultural arts and recreational facility and a boathouse. The project is estimated to cost $38 million. In September 2009, a $10 million budget was approved to start development on the 6-acre (24,000 m) area along the Chicago River.","lastUpdated":"2012-04-21T07:35:11+0000","wikipedia_id":"Ping Tom Memorial Park","wikipedia_numeric_id":10904376,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_Tom_Memorial_Park","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"ping_tom_memorial_park","md5id":"7d00cf0b3a4a499684f610dbf5f7c4ba","description":"Ping Tom Memorial Park is a 17.24-acre (6.98 ha) public urban park in Chicago's Chinatown owned and operated by the Chicago Park District (CPD).

Designed by Frederick and Edward Baumann it was built between 1873&ndash;1874 in the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on January 14, 1997. When completed, Washington Block was one of the tallest buildings in the city of Chicago and is described as a rare example of the \"isolated pier foundation\" (see below) which contributed to the foundation of knowledge that has made Chicago the birthplace of the skyscraper. The building has limestone facades and originally included an exterior staircase that led to a second-floor corner entrance. The lobby has a curving hardwood staircase. Today the first floor is occupied by a 7-Eleven. The building, which is located at the corner of North Wells Street and West Washington Street is five storeys tall. The building was originally intended to host upscale offices for companies wanting to be close to the nearby then-blossoming LaSalle Street financial district. However, when the Chicago 'L' was built next to the building, the upscale commercial customer found the building undesirable. During the mid 1900s, the owner hammered off ground-level architectural details in order to modernize the storefronts. 21st century owners have recast some of the details during a restoration. The isolated pier technique uses several separate foundations, one at each of the load-bearing points underground. Thus, instead of using a single foundation that would crack as the building shifted on sandy soil, a building may be built on a much longer-lasting and sturdier foundation. The Washington Block's foundation enabled it to be built on soft, compressible soil, instead of the solid bedrock formerly seen as a requirement. This ability allowed skyscrapers to be built in places like Chicago, and many of them were.","lastUpdated":"2012-11-06T06:20:40+0000","wikipedia_id":"Washington Block","wikipedia_numeric_id":18670278,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Block","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"washington_block","md5id":"20d534f31945562c6ab2771789a760d8","description":"Washington Block is a Chicago Landmark building located in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois, United States.

The Old Town Triangle Historic District is bounded on its northwest side by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way,[3 3] its northeast side by Lincoln Avenue and Wells Street, and on its south side by North Avenue.[4 4] This historic district sits within the Old Town Triangle Association (OTTA), a Lincoln Park neighborhood bounded by the former Ogden Avenue right-of-way, Clark Street and North Avenue. It sits inside the community area of Lincoln Park and is part of Chicago's 43rd ward. Old Town north of North Avenue is in Lincoln Park, and south of North Avenue is part of the Near North Side. It is now an affluent gentrified neighborhood. Old Town is today considered an affluent and historic neighborhood, home to many of Chicago's older, Victorian-era buildings. In the 1950s,the majority of this area was an enclave to the first Puerto Ricans to emigrate to Chicago. They referred to this area as part of \"La Clark\" until commercialization decorated late 1960s shop signs with the name of Old Town. The neighborhood is home to St. Michael's Church, originally a Bavarian-built church, and one of 7 to survive the path of the Great Chicago Fire. St. Michael's, Holy Name Cathedral, Immaculate Conception and St. Joseph's catered also to Latinos with Spanish speaking masses. The neighborhood is also home to the famed The Second City improvisational comedy troupe. Many of the streets and alleys, particularly in the Old Town Triangle section, predate the Great Chicago Fire and do not all adhere to a typical Chicago grid pattern. In 1927, sculptors Sol Kogen and Edgar Miller purchased and subsequently rehabilited a house on Burton Place, near Wells Street, into the Carl Street Studios. Through the 1930s, an art colony emerged in the neighborhood as artists moved from the Towertown neighborhood near Washington Square Park. Old Town was also home to many gays &amp; lesbians from the 1950s through the 1980s. There were numerous gay bars lining Wells Street (all of them closed now). This was the first \"gay ghetto\" in Chicago, predating the current Lake View neighborhood (which is the current epicenter of gay life). As the area gentrified, the gays moved further north to Lincoln Park and then Lake View neighborhoods. Old Town has one Brown-Purple Line 'L' station at 1536-40 North Sedgwick Avenue. It is one of the oldest standing stations on the 'L'.","lastUpdated":"2012-03-23T14:47:56+0000","wikipedia_id":"Old Town, Chicago","wikipedia_numeric_id":3415657,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town,_Chicago","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"old_town_chicago","md5id":"d2bda40d6e08a955286fbb633d532534","description":"Old Town is a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois, bounded by the Ogden Ave. right-of-way on the northwest, Larrabee Street on the west, Clybourn Avenue on the southwest and Division Street on the south and Clark Street on the east and northeast.

Van Buren Street, in a location formerly known as the \"Pacific Beer Garden. \" The current name, \"Pacific Garden Mission,\" was adopted at that time - it was suggested by evangelist D.L. Moody that the name of the former occupant be kept but with the word \"Beer\" dropped from the name. The Mission moved to 646 S. State Street, in 1923, following a shift in the location of Chicago's Skid Row, just south of The Loop. At that time, the area known for its hobo jungles and flophouses. During the past few years the PGM was pressured by the city of Chicago to move from its current location, due to ongoing gentrification in the neighborhood. Then, Jones College Prep, a public high school located at 606 S. State Street, wanted to expand its facilities. As a result, the Mission negotiated with the city in December 2004 to move to a new location at 14th Place and Canal Street, about one mile southwest of its present location. PGM's current structure will be demolished to make way for the Jones College Prep. Groundbreaking for the new facility took place on November 16, 2005, at 1458 S. Canal Street. The building, designed by noted Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman, of Tigerman McCurry Architects, was completed in 2007, with the formal dedication October 13, 2007.","lastUpdated":"2012-05-24T13:45:14+0000","wikipedia_id":"Pacific Garden Mission","wikipedia_numeric_id":10886213,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Garden_Mission","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"pacific_garden_mission","md5id":"2aad1830a523f6774aaa22682ac62c6a","description":"Pacific Garden Mission is a homeless shelter in the South Loop section of Chicago, Illinois, founded in 1877, by Colonel George Clarke and his wife, Sarah.

Founded in 1853 as the Mt. Carroll Seminary in the frontier town of Mt. Carroll, Illinois, by Frances Wood Shimer, it was a women's school for most of its early years. It joined with the University of Chicago (U. of C. ) in 1896, and became one of the first junior colleges in the country in 1907. It became a co-educational four-year college in 1950, took the name Shimer College, and adopted the Hutchins Plan of Great Books and Socratic seminars then in practice at the U. of C. The U. of C. relationship ended in 1958. Shimer enjoyed national recognition and strong growth in the 1960s but was forced by financial problems to abandon its campus in 1979. The college moved to a makeshift campus in the Chicago suburb of Waukegan where it remained until 2006, when it moved to the main campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in the Douglas community area of Chicago. Classes are exclusively small seminars in which students discuss original source material in lieu of textbooks. The curriculum, a sequence of courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and integrated studies makes up two thirds of the course work required for a degree. Shimer has offered a study abroad program in Oxford, England, since 1963 and a Weekend Program for working adults since 1981. Applicants are evaluated on their academic potential, primarily based on an essay, and no minimum grades or test scores are required. An Early Entrant program, in place since 1950, allows students who have not yet completed high school to matriculate. It has the highest rates of doctoral productivity of any liberal arts college in the country. Fifty percent of students go on to graduate study; twenty percent complete doctoral degrees. Shimer resides on the IIT main campus, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Shimer practices democratic self-governance to an extent that it states \"is rare among institutions of higher education\". Since 1977, the college has been governed internally by faculty, staff, and students working through a structure of committees and an egalitarian deliberative body called the Assembly. Shimer enrolled 100 students in 2009. Students maintain Shimer College traditions but also participate in the student life of IIT. Notable alumni include poets, authors, political theorists, experimental artists, and computing pioneers.","lastUpdated":"2012-09-17T00:48:58+0000","wikipedia_id":"Shimer College","wikipedia_numeric_id":27255579,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimer_College","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"shimer_college","md5id":"81483d99209cd5d442d6a1d7f6ddc1a9","description":"Shimer College is a very small, private, undergraduate liberal arts college in Chicago, Illinois, in the United States.

It was the first building to use structural steel in its frame, but the majority of its structure was composed of cast and wrought iron. It is generally noted as the first tall building to be supported, both inside and outside, by a fireproof metal frame. Although, the Ditherington Flax Mill was built as a fireproof metal framed building earlier, it was only five stories tall. Due to the Chicago building's unique architecture and unique weight bearing frame, it is considered to be the first skyscraper in the world. It had 10 stories and rose to a height of 138 feet (42 m). In 1890, two additional floors were built on top of the original 10-story building. A forensic analysis done during its demolition purported to show that the building was the first to carry both floors and external walls entirely on its metal frame, but details and later scholarship have arguably disproved this, and it has been asserted that the structure must have relied upon both metal and masonry elements to support its weight, and to hold it up against wind. Although the Home Insurance Building made full use of steel framing technology, in this theory it was not a pure steel-framed structure since it rested partly on granite piers at the base and on a rear brick wall. The architect was William Le Baron Jenney, an engineer. In fact, the building weighed only one-third as much as a stone building would have; city officials were so concerned that they halted construction while they investigated its safety. The Home Insurance Building is an example of the Chicago School in architecture. The building led to the future in the skyscrapers. \u00E2\u0080\u009CIn 1888, a Minneapolis architect named Leroy S. Buffington was granted a patent on the idea of building skeletal-frame tall buildings. He even proposed the construction of a 28-story \"stratosphere-scraper\"--a notion mocked by the architectural press of the time as impractical and ludicrous. Nevertheless, Buffington brought the potential of the iron skeletal frame to the attention of the national architectural and building communities. Architects and engineers began using the idea, which in primitive form had been around for decades. \u00E2\u0080\u009D The Bank of America Building (former Field Building and then Lasalle Bank Building), where the Home Insurance Building once stood, contains a plaque in the lobby that reads: This section of the Field Building is erected on the site of the Home Insurance Building which structure, designed and built in eighteen hundred and eighty four by the late William Le Baron Jenney, was the first high building to utilize as the basic principle of its design the method known as skeleton construction and, being a primal influence in the acceptance of this principle was the true father of the skyscraper, 1932","lastUpdated":"2012-11-03T09:12:33+0000","wikipedia_id":"Home Insurance Building","wikipedia_numeric_id":8727539,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Insurance_Building","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"home_insurance_building","md5id":"e5279eed17a4f88a85956c6127627a25","description":"The Home Insurance Building was built in 1884 in Chicago, Illinois, USA and destroyed in 1931 to make way for the Field Building.

Dewes House is a house located at 503 West Wrightwood Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The house was built in 1896 by Adolph Cudell and Arthur Hercz for brewer Francis J. Dewes. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 12, 1974. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973 Wealthy German immigrants, including Wacker, Leight, Gaetner, Deever, and Schlosser, constructed luxurious mansions east of Clark Street in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Francis Dewes, a Chicago brewer and millionaire, built the most elaborate home in the Lincoln Park still standing - Dewes Mansion at 503 West Wrightwood Avenue. Architects Adolph Cudell and Arthur Hercz designed the Dewes mansion, and it was completed in 1896. Hercz was originally from Hungary, and Cudell was no stranger to building grand residences for Chicago's wealthy elite. In 1879 Cudell also designed the Rush Street mansion of prominent businessman Cyrus Hall McCormick. The Dewes mansion was built for Francis J. Dewes, a brewer. Dewes was born in Prusia in 1845, the son of a brewer and member of the German parliament. In 1868 Francis Dewes emigrated to Chicago and found employment as a bookkeeper for established brewing companies such as Rehm and Bartholomae and the Busch and Brand Brewing Company. He rose through the ranks, and in 1882 he founded his own successful brewing firm. His mansion was built to reflect his own Prussian background and European tastes. Taken as a whole, the building is an unusual example of a German inspired style, influenced by the neo-Baroque architecture of Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the end of the nineteenth century. The exterior of this lavish gray-stone is decorated with carved stonework and ornamental cornices and lintels.

The street has a rich history from its origins as a major trail for horseback riders and carriages. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-block section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic Prairie Avenue District, which was declared a Chicago Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places. Several of Chicago's most important historical figures have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the political history, the architecture, the culture, the economy, as well as the law and government of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the demographics of Chicago. The importance of the street has declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of an historic district. Preservation battles regarding various properties on the street have been notable with one having been chronicled on the front page of The New York Times. As of 2009, the street is being redeveloped to host valuable and important condominiums. Recently, developments have extended the street north to accommodate new high-rise condominiums, such as One Museum Park, along Roosevelt Road (12th Street).

The district was operated by a group of railroad companies that acquired swampland, and turned it to a centralized processing area. It operated in the New City community area of Chicago, Illinois for 106 years, helping the city become known as \"hog butcher for the world\" and the center of the American meat packing industry for decades. The stockyards became the focal point of the rise of some of the earliest international companies. These companies refined novel industrial innovations and influenced financial markets. Both the rise and fall of the district owe their fortunes to the evolution of transportation services and technology in America. The stockyards have become an integral part of the popular culture of Chicago's history. From the Civil War until the 1920s and peaking in 1924, more meat was processed in Chicago than in any other place in the world.

It was built on Northerly Island, the man-made peninsula that was also the site of the 1933\u00E2\u0080\u00931934 Century of Progress in Chicago. The airport opened on December 10, 1948, and became the country's busiest single-strip airport by 1955. The latest air traffic tower was built in 1952 and the terminal was dedicated in 1961. The airfield was named for Merrill C. Meigs, publisher of the Chicago Herald and Examiner and an aviation booster. Northerly Island, owned by the Chicago Park District, is the only lakefront structure to be built based on Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The island was to be populated by trees and grass for the public enjoyment by all. However, drafted less than six years after the Wright brothers' historic flight, the 1909 plan did not envision any airports for Chicago. The airport was a familiar sight on the downtown lakefront. It was also well-known as the default takeoff field in many early versions of the popular Microsoft Flight Simulator software program. It is an airport that is featured in Microsoft's Midtown Madness computer game (1999) and Reflections' Driver 2 video game, which are based in Chicago. The airport area is also the central location of the short documentary film Powers of Ten by Charles and Ray Eames. The Main Terminal Building was operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and contained waiting areas as well as office and counter space. The runway at Meigs Field was nearly 3,900 feet (1,200 m) long and 150 feet (46 m) wide. In addition, there were four public helicopter pads at the south end of the runway, near McCormick Place. The north end of the runway was near the Adler Planetarium.","lastUpdated":"2012-10-01T06:15:57+0000","wikipedia_id":"Meigs Field","wikipedia_numeric_id":265573,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meigs_Field","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"meigs_field","md5id":"216e6f019fb5d76a8400402cf36f550a","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"Merrill C.

Designed by Claes Oldenburg, it takes the shape of a baseball bat standing on its knob. It consists of gray-painted Corten steel arranged into an open latticework structure. Batcolumn stands outside the Harold Washington Social Security Administration Building at 600 West Madison Street near downtown Chicago. The United States General Services Administration commissioned the sculpture, which was dedicated in 1977. Oldenburg originally designed the sculpture to be painted red, but he abandoned that idea to distinguish it from Chicago's Flamingo sculpture by Alexander Calder. Oldenburg instead had Batcolumn painted gray, which he also hoped would make the sculpture easier to see against the sky. A plaque on the sculpture reads, \"Oldenburg selected the baseball bat as an emblem of Chicago's ambition and vigor. The sculpture's verticality echoes the city's dramatic skyline, while its form and scale cleverly allude to more traditional civic monuments, such as obelisks and memorial columns. \" The sculpture has been a source of controversy. On the day of its dedication, a number of people came to protest, holding signs saying \"Tear it down\" and \"Expensive joke\". However, Batcolumn has also had its defenders. A 2005 Chicago Tribune article named it one of the newspaper's favorite Chicago sculptures (along with Standing Lincoln and the lions outside the Art Institute of Chicago Building).","lastUpdated":"2012-03-23T16:05:03+0000","wikipedia_id":"Batcolumn","wikipedia_numeric_id":26436687,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcolumn","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"batcolumn","md5id":"84853ae5422a7f913a7c1f7d305585e2","description":"Batcolumn (or Bat Column) is a Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSmid outdoor sculpture in Chicago.

It was located on the west side of Halsted Street at 43rd Street on the city's south side, adjacent to the Union Stock Yards. The arena was built for $1.5 million by the stock yard company principally to host the International Livestock Exhibition. The arena replaced Dexter Park, a horse-racing track that had stood on the site for over 50 years prior to its destruction by fire in May 1934. The completion of the Amphitheater ushered in an era where Chicago reigned as a convention capital. In an era before air conditioning and space for the press and broadcast media were commonplace, the International Amphitheater was among the first arenas to be equipped with these innovations. The arena, which seated 9,000, was the first home of the Chicago Packers of the NBA during 1961-62, before changing their name to the Chicago Zephyrs and moving to the Chicago Coliseum for their second season. It was also the home of the Chicago Bulls during their inaugural season of 1966-67; they also played only one game in the Chicago Coliseum, a playoff game in their first season, as no other arena was available for a game versus the St. Louis Hawks. Afterwards, the Bulls then moved permanently to Chicago Stadium, not the Coliseum. The Amphitheatre was also the primary home of the Chicago Cougars of the WHA from 1972-1975. It was originally intended to be only a temporary home for the Cougars, but the permanent solution, the Rosemont Horizon","lastUpdated":"2012-07-02T00:33:18+0000","wikipedia_id":"International Amphitheatre","wikipedia_numeric_id":4700748,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Amphitheatre","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"international_amphitheatre","md5id":"9d1def5125a084cd52d79589eccad027","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"The International Amphitheatre was an indoor arena, located in Chicago, Illinois, between 1934 and 1999.

It is bronze work of art created between 1907-1913. The fountain depicts five women arranged so that the water flows through them in the same way water passes through the Great Lakes. Note that the Great Lakes waterflow starts in Lake Superior at 600 feet (180 m) above sea level and continues eastward through each lake until it reaches Lake Ontario and then passes into the St. Lawrence River. The Fountain is one of Taft's best known works. The fountain was originally installed facing south where it remained until 1963 when it was moved next to the Morton Wing addition facing west where it sits today. In its original location it was visible from the Jackson and Michigan Avenue intersection once known as \"route center\" to the south. The fountain was commissioned by the Benjamin Ferguson fund and one surface references the title B. F. Ferguson Fountain of the Great Lakes. There is a relief sculpture of Benjamin Ferguson on the rear panel that has been hidden from view since the fountain was moved. As the first commission from the Ferguson Fund, it experienced various funding delays. Additionally, the legal environment for land use in Grant Park was in flux at the time the commission was made, which caused delays in location selection. Once erected, the fountain received largely positive reviews, but a few critics questioned symbolism of the sculpture. Others were caught up in sociopolitical subtexts of the day, with regard to obscenity laws as it related to public art and this semi-nude work.","lastUpdated":"2012-10-30T08:22:54+0000","wikipedia_id":"Fountain of the Great Lakes","wikipedia_numeric_id":11721566,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_the_Great_Lakes","_type":"encyclopedic.wikipedia.wikipedia_article","_id":"fountain_of_the_great_lakes","md5id":"ddf3e566975589e6c2b71894e2f9c031","relations":[{"to":"wikipedia_id:United_States","rel":"geo_related"}],"description":"Fountain of the Great Lakes or Spirit of the Great Lakes Fountain is an allegorical sculpture by Lorado Taft in the Art Institute of Chicago South Stanley McCormick Memorial Court south of the Art Institute of Chicago Building in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States.
