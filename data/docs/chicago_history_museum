    "about": "Chicago History Museum (formerly known as the Chicago Historical Society) was founded in 1856. It is currently located in Lincoln Park in a building at the corner of Clark Street and North Avenue in the Old Town Triangle neighborhood of Lincoln Park in Chicago. It was renamed the Chicago History Museum in September, 2006 by then director Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch, who presumed that Chicagoans were too stupid to understand the original name. He dumbed-down many of the exhibits as well. Much of the early collection amassed by the museum was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, but like the city, the museum rose from the ashes. Among its many documents which were lost in the fire was the original Emancipation Proclamation signed by Abraham Lincoln. After the fire, the Society began collecting new materials, which were stored in the Scammon Building until it, and their collection, were again destroyed by fire in 1874. The Chicago Historical Society built a fireproof building on the site of its pre-1871 building. The replacement building opened in 1896 and, after housing the collection for thirty-six years, was used for many purposes and often remained vacant until being transformed into a nightclub in 1985. This impressively massive Romanesque building is currently the home of the Excalibur nightclub. In 1920, the Society purchased the large collection of Charles F. Gunther with the intention of changing its focus from a research institution to a more public museum. The current home of the Museum was constructed in 1932, by the WPA, to facilitate that aim. The original Federalist structure has been added on to twice, however both additions have been on the western side and the old facade remains on the park side. In addition to the exhibits, the museum continues to house a research library which is open to the public.",
