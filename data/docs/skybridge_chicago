    "about": "Skybridge is a high-rise luxury condominium located in the West Loop of Chicago. It won the 2003 bronze Emporis Skyscraper Award. The base of the building is home to a Dominick's grocery store. The building climbs to 38 stories, while the top two are home to the penthouses. The 36th floor boasts a workout facility for tenants and a roof-top garden space. Designed by Perkins+Will, this is the tallest building West of the Dan Ryan Expressway, and due to the setback from the city offers one of the nicest panoramic views of the skyline as seen from the West.",
