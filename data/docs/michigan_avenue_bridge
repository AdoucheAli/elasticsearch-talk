    "about": "The Michigan Avenue Bridge is a bascule bridge that carries Michigan Avenue across the main stem of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, Illinois, United States. The bridge was constructed between 1918 and 1920 as part of a scheme to link Chicago's south side and north side parks with a grand boulevard. It is an early example of a fixed trunnion bascule bridge, which later became widely known as a "Chicago style bascule"; it is part of the Michiganâ€“Wacker Historic District and is a Chicago Landmark. In addition to providing passage for vehicles and pedestrians on two levels, the bridge connects historically important sites and commemorates Chicago history with public art, relief sculptures on its facade.",
