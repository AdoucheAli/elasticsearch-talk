    "about": "The NBC Tower is an office tower on the Near north side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is also the home studios and offices for the NBC owned station in Chicago, WMAQ-TV, and the radio studios for CBS Radio's sports radio station WSCR (AM), which were formerly in use under WSCR's original operation, WMAQ (AM). Completed in 1989, the 37-story building reaches a height of 627 feet (191 m). The design, by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, is considered one of the finest reproductions of the Art Deco style and similar to the GE Building in New York City. The tower is further enhanced by the use of limestone piers and recessed tinted glass with granite spandrels. The building takes cues from the nearby landmark Tribune Tower with the use of flying buttresses. A 130-foot (40 m) broadcast tower and spire tops the skyscraper. WMAQ/NBC has STL and satellite facilities on the roof and does not actually transmit from the tower, as those facilities are atop Willis Tower. The building, located in the Cityfront Plaza area, contains 850,000 square feet (79,000 m) of space and three floors of underground parking with 261 spaces. Connected to the main tower is a four-story radio and television broadcasting facility where popular shows such as Jerry Springer and The Steve Wilkos Show were taped.",
